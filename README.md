A customer can purchase one or more items from the supplier. Customers create their accounts to purchase items in the online shopping system. Customers can request an order using their credit card information stored in the accounts. When the credit card payment is approved, the delivery order is created. The supplier checks the available inventory and processes the delivery order if available. When the delivery order is shipped, the supplier is confirmed. The order status is updated as the supplier processes the order. The detailed requirements are described in the use case model and use case description. The communication diagrams for the main sequence of each use case scenario are given below. 1. Define classes and their attributes and operations for the online shopping system. 2. Implement each use case in the online shopping system in Java. Store customer accounts, delivery order, inventory, and catalog data in files (or database).
